-------------

Integration of my Imagine renderer into Katana 1.5/1.6.

Very basic first steps currently as a prototype.

Supports Preview Renders, Disk Renders to EXR, some of Imagine's integrated materials to a limited extent (no nodal shading connections), physical sky light / envlight / skydome light types, and polymesh and subdmesh geometry, with UV support, and instanceSource type instancing.

Requires Katana plugins_api directory for building Katana API lib, and Imagine's main src/ subdirectory.
