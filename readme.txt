-------------

Integration of my Imagine renderer into Katana 1.5/1.6.

Very basic first steps currently as a prototype.

Supports Disk Renders to EXR, default material, physical sky light and polymesh and subdmesh geometry.


Requires Katana plugins_api directory for building Katana API lib, and Imagine's main src/ subdirectory.
